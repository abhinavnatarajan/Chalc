Chalc is a Python package to compute chromatic Delaunay filtrations from labelled datasets in Euclidean space.
Chromatic Delaunay filtrations are a family of combinatorial objects that capture spatial relations among the classes of a labelled dataset.
You can find more details on the math behind chromatic Delaunay filtrations in the following papers:

[Chromatic Alpha Complexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03128)\
[Morse Theory for Chromatic Delaunay Triangulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19303)


For instructions on how to install and use chalc, read the [documentation](https://abhinavnatarajan.github.io/Chalc).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since the release of NumPy 2.0, versions of chalc older than 2.0.0 won't work correctly. This is due to a bug in these package versions related to dependency specification. If you are using an older version of chalc, please make sure to install a compatible version of NumPy (â‰¥ 1.24.2 and < 2.0.0).
