	abstract = {Motivated by applications in medical sciences, we study finite chromatic sets in Euclidean space from a topological perspective. Based on persistent homology for images, kernels and cokernels, we design provably stable homological quantifiers that describe the geometric micro- and macro-structure of how the color classes mingle. These can be efficiently computed using chromatic variants of Delaunay mosaics and Alpha complexes.},

	abstract = {A simple randomized algorithm is developed which computes the smallest enclosing disk of a finite set of points in the plane in expected linear time. The algorithm is based on Seidel's recent Linear Programming algorithm, and it can be generalized to computing smallest enclosing balls or ellipsoids of point sets in higher dimensions in a straightforward way. Experimental results of an implementation are presented.},
