# Chalc Documentation Source Directory

To build the documentation, first make sure that ``chalc`` and its development dependencies are installed and available to the Python interpreter. Then run the following commands from the root directory of the repository.

```bash
make -C docs html
```

This will build the documentation into the folder ``docs/build`` with root ``index.html``.
